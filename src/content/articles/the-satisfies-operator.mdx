# The `satisfies` Operator

TypeScript 4.9 introduces a new operator, `satisfies`, that allows opting into a different kind of type inference from the type system's default.
`satisfies` brings the best of type annotations and default type inference together in a useful manner.
Let's explore the new `satisfies` operator and why it's useful!

## Recap: Default Type Inference

TypeScript's default type inference for objects defaults to inferring primitive values for types, rather than literals.
For example, the `vibe.mood` property in the following value is `string`, not `"happy"`:

```ts twoslash
const vibe = {
  mood: "happy",
  // ^?
};
```

TypeScript's default inference is not always optimal since you might want to have a different type.
For our `vibe.mood`, we might have wanted `"happy"` - or maybe even a union of string literals, such as `"happy" | "sad"`.

### Type Declarations

You can use a `:` type annotation to specify a variable's type.
Doing so tells TypeScript to use the annotated type for the variable instead of its default inference.

For example, using a `: Vibe` type annotation on the `vibe` variable here switches its `mood` property from `string` to `"happy" | "sad"`:

```ts twoslash
interface Vibe {
  mood: "happy" | "sad";
}

const vibe: Vibe = {
  mood: "happy",
  // ^?
};

vibe.mood;
//   ^?
```

But, this has a flaw too!
See the type of `vibe.mood` after the variable declaration.
As developers reading the code, we know `vibe.mood` should be the more specific (_"narrow"_) `"happy"`, not the more general (_"wide"_) `"happy" | "sad"`.

> [`as const` type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) can also be used to modify types.
> But those add `readonly` to all array and object types, which also might not be what you want.

## `satisfies` to the Rescue

TypeScript 4.9's new `satisfies` operator introduces a happy compromise between `:` annotations and the default type inference.
The syntax for `satisfies` is to place it after a value and before a name of a type:

```ts
someValue satisfies SomeType;
```

`satisfies` applies the best of both worlds:

- The value must adhere to a specific shape (as with `:` declarations )
- Type inference is still allowed to give the value a more narrow shape than the declared type

In other words, `satisfies` makes sure a value's type matches some type shape, but doesn't _widen_ the type unnecessarily.

We can use `satisfies` on our `vibe` object to make sure its `mood` property allowed to be only is `"happy" | "sad"`, but is still only `"happy"` afterwards:

```ts twoslash
interface Vibe {
  mood: "happy" | "sad";
}

const vibe = {
  mood: "happy",
  // ^?
} satisfies Vibe;

vibe.mood;
//   ^?
```

By using `satisfies`, we were able to make sure our `vibe` matched the `Vibe` interface, without forcing too wide a type for the `mood` property.

You can read more about `satisfies` in the [TypeScript 4.9 beta release notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9-beta/#hamilton).

## Real World Usage: Next.js

The [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org) provides an excellent example of how `satisfies` improves the coding experience for TypeScript developers.
Its [data fetching patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) such as [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) and [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) allow users to declare functions with those names in order to retrieve data for a component.

A simplified version of the `GetServerSideProps` type might look like:

```ts twoslash
export type GetServerSideProps<Props> = (
  context: GetServerSidePropsContext
) => Promise<GetServerSidePropsResult<Props>>;

export interface GetServerSidePropsContext {
  query: Record<string, string>;
}

export type GetServerSidePropsResult<P> =
  | { props: P | Promise<P> }
  | { notFound: true };
```

Before `satisfies`, there was no good way to declare many generic `getServerSideProps` functions without using explicit type annotations.

Code could use an explicit generic `: GetServerSideProps<...>` type annotation, but then that would need to be explicitly told a function type parameter for the generic `Props` type argument:

```ts twoslash
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

export interface MyPageData {
  locale: string | undefined;
  rating: number;
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<MyPageData> = async (
  context
) => ({
  props: {
    locale: context.locale,
    rating: Math.random(),
  },
});
```

Leaving out the `: GetServerSideProps<...>` type annotation meant the `getServerSideProps` function wouldn't be inferred to satisfy that type.
Its `context` parameter would be implicitly type `any` without a type annotation.
Even if `context` were to be removed or given a proper `: ServerSidePropsContext` type annotation, nothing would enforce the function has the right return type:

```ts twoslash
import { GetServerSidePropsContext } from "next";

export const getServerSideProps = (context: GetServerSidePropsContext) => ({
  locale: context.locale,
  rating: Math.random(),
});
// No error, even though this is returning the wrong object type shape
// (it should have wrapped its props in a `props` property)
```

### Next.js and `satisfies`

Now with TypeScript's `satisfies` operator, we can have the best of both worlds:

- We can declare our `getServerSideProps` function with proper parameter and return types
- We can allow its `props` generic type to be inferred from data

```ts twoslash
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

export const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {
  return {
    props: {
      locale: context.locale,
      rating: Math.random(),
    },
  };
}) satisfies GetServerSideProps;

getServerSideProps;
// ^?
```

By adding `satisfies GetServerSideProps` after our function, we were able to enforce that it adheres to the proper Next.js interface -- while still allowing it to infer a generic type for its `props`.
Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

## Using `satisfies` Today

As of November 14 2022, TypeScript 4.9 is still in beta.
That means in order to use `satisfies`, you'll have to install `typescript@4.9-beta` or newer:

```shell
npm i typescript@4.9-beta --save-dev
```

> This post will be updated when TypeScript 4.9 is released as stable this week.

You can also try out the latest ("nightly") version of TypeScript in your browser on [typescriptlang.org/play?ts=next](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?ts=next).

> [Here's a TypeScript playground with the Next.js `GetServerSideProps` example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?ts=5.0.0-dev.20221114#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgcQKYwMqqgN2x4AE1QAUoIwBnOAXzgDNyQ4AiAO1QA8YWBuAKH5dIsOAGMIbSvADm6LLnxFS5KnAC8cABQBDSgE82Y7RLYwuMAJQaAfIn5w4UdAFcobe48dhVlAFyeXo4ANhBiOsGoAabm3AB0oeGRADQOQU46MMBsMgEAspkAFnFQOmyEECBalqlBNLW0AjTWlJnAlPTAqNRomNh4UATEZBSUAvxyfYqDyiNUAgD0C3AAegD8QA).

## _Learning TypeScript_ and `satisfies`

The `satisfies` operator was designed and released after the _Learning TypeScript_ book's contents were finalized.
`satisfies` is not mentioned in _Learning TypeScript_.

Still, _Learning TypeScript_'s [The Type System chapter](http://localhost:3000/the-type-system) teaches all the concepts you'll need to be able to understand TypeScript's type system.
That includes how the type system works, the default type inferences mentioned in this article, and explicitly using `:` type annotations.
